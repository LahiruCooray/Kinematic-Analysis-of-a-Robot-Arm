# Kinematic-Analysis-of-a-Robot-Arm
The objective of this mini project is to perform a kinematic analysis of a simple robot arm constructed using servo motors. The analysis will involve creating a Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) table, calculating the forward kinematics, deriving the inverse kinematics, and finding the manipulator Jacobian for a pick and place task.
